1. Download vim
	http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc

2. Install vim

3. Ensure that you can open gVim.

	gVim should open up like any other PC application - it's not terminal.

4. Ensure that 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim' exists.
	
	If not, check 'C:\Program Files\' to see if there is a Vim folder.

	If there is no Vim folder, simply make a new folder called 'Vim' 
	and place it in the 'Program File (x86)' directory.

5. Copy '_vimrc' and '_gvimrc' and put them in the 'Vim' file

6. Relaunch the gVim application.


It should all be working now.





7. Read through the '_vimrc' and be sure to edit
	
	'colorscheme'
	'columns' and 'lines'
	'visualbell'
	
	try commenting out
	line 48 (listchars)
	line 18 (errorbells)

8. Adjust text size and font on line 5 of gvimrc

	Try uncommenting lines 10 - 12 in gvimrc
